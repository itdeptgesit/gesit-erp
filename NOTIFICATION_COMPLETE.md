# Resolution Update

I have resolved the `Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag` error shown in your screenshot.

**The Fix:**
I identified that the `{!isSolved ? ... : ...}` ternary operator inside the Right Column (around line 1333) was missing its closing `)}` brace. This caused the parser to misinterpret the subsequent `</div>` tags, leading to the "Adjacent JSX elements" error.

**Actions Taken:**
1.  **Inserted Missing Brace:** Added the missing `)}` closure at the end of the `!isSolved` expression.
2.  **Verified Structure:** Re-checked the component nesting to ensure all `<div>` tags and conditional blocks are properly balanced.

The `HelpdeskManager.tsx` file should now compile without structural errors. Please review the updated UI.
